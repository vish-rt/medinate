            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>Step 1: Determine if the medicine is eligible for donation.<br>
All donated medication must meet the following criteria:<br>

*Is unexpired. 
*Is unopened and in tamper-evident packaging. 
Does not require refrigeration. 
 <br>

Step 2: Check your state’s regulations on medicine donation<br>
Use the National Conference of State Legislature’s table on state prescription drug recycling laws to see the specific requirements for your state and find out if you are an eligible donor.<br>

If your state does not have a drug repository program, or if individuals are ineligible donors, you still have options. <br>

Step 3: Fill out the required forms<br>
Be prepared to include some general information, like your name and contact information, the date of the donation, your signature, etc. You may also need to add details about each medication you are donating. <br>

Step 4: Remove any personal information from the packaging<br>
Cover any personal information on the prescription label, like the patient’s name or the prescription number, using a permanent marker.<br>

Be careful not to cover any information about the medication itself. Pharmacists who review and sort these donations will need to see the drug name, expiration date and dosage.<br>

Step 5: Coordinate shipping or drop-off of the medication<br>
Follow the specific programs instructions to either mail your donation or take it to a designated drop-off site. For example, in Georgia, you must take all donations to a certified pharmacy. Other programs, like the one in Wyoming, ask that in-state donors use a drop-off site and out-of-state donors ship medicine.</p>

                Drug donation services like Medinate and SIRUM represent an option for individuals and organizations that want to help reduce prescription drug waste. These nonprofits receive and manage tons of donations, inspecting and processing each one. Then, they match donations with requests from eligible individual patients or health care facilities.

                <p>Medicines have expiry dates that indicate the date upto which the manufacturer guarantees their potency and efficacy. “Ongoing research shows that stored under optimal conditions, many drugs retain 90% of their potency for at least five years after the labeled expiration date, and sometimes longer.” says Dan Gikonya.The quality assurance manager of a large pharma company whom I talked to in this regard said that as long as the medicine has not visibly deteriorated, it should be safe to take for at least two years post the expiry date. However, for obvious reasons, expired medicines are inappropriate to donate for human consumption.
