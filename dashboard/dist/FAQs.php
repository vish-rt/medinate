                <p>You must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood and 16 weeks (112 days) between Power Red donations. Whole blood donors can donate up to 6 times a year. Platelet apheresis donors may give every 7 days up to 24 times per year. Regulations are different for those giving blood for themselves (autologous donors).</p>

To donate blood, you must weigh at least 110 pounds (about 50 kilograms) and be at least 16 or 17 years old, depending on the law in your state. Some states allow legal minors to donate with parental permission. You must be in good health and able to pass the physical and a confidential health-history assessment to help make sure blood donation is safe for both you and the recipient of the blood.

                <p>The Food and Drug Administration suggests waiting to donate blood for at least 14 days after a positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 without symptoms or for at least 14 days after symptoms of COVID-19 have completely cleared up. Those who have tested positive for COIVD-19 antibodies but didn't have a diagnostic test and never developed symptoms can donate without a waiting period or having a diagnostic test done before donation.</p>

                <p>When you donate blood, you're helping others and giving back to your community. Donated blood benefits people in local hospitals who need blood transfusions. Each whole blood donation may help as many as three people. Donated blood helps meet many medical needs, including those of people who have lost blood due to trauma, an organ transplant or other major surgery, as well as those who cannot make enough blood on their own due to illness or treatment.</p>
