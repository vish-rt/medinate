                <p>All donated medication must meet the following criteria:<br>

1)Is unexpired. Some organizations also require the medicine not expire in the near future.<br>
2)Is unopened and in tamper-evident packaging. “Tamper-evident” means the packaging leaves visual evidence once opened (such as a plastic seal). Unit-dose systems, like blister packs, are an example of tamper-evident packaging. Amber vials are not tamper-evident and therefore ineligible for donation.<br>
3)Does not require refrigeration. Some medications require cold storage, such as insulins, injections and eye drops. These are not eligible for donation.<br>
4)Is not a controlled substance. Controlled substances are drugs that are regulated under federal law and can cause physical and mental dependence.</p>

                Drug donation services like Medinate and SIRUM represent an option for individuals and organizations that want to help reduce prescription drug waste. These nonprofits receive and manage tons of donations, inspecting and processing each one. Then, they match donations with requests from eligible individual patients or health care facilities.

            <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>Medicines have expiry dates that indicate the date upto which the manufacturer guarantees their potency and efficacy. “Ongoing research shows that stored under optimal conditions, many drugs retain 90% of their potency for at least five years after the labeled expiration date, and sometimes longer.” says Dan Gikonya.The quality assurance manager of a large pharma company whom I talked to in this regard said that as long as the medicine has not visibly deteriorated, it should be safe to take for at least two years post the expiry date. However, for obvious reasons, expired medicines are inappropriate to donate for human consumption.
